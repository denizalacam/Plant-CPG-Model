We study the rhythmogenesis of oscillatory patterns emerging  network motifs composed of inhibitory coupled tonic 
spiking neurons represented by the Plant Model of R15 nerve cells. Such motifs are argued to be used as building blocks
 for a larger central pattern generator network controlling the swim locomotion of the sea slug Melibe leonina.
